## Process
- **Data Import & Cleaning:** Used Power Query to import sales data from multiple sources and perform cleaning tasks like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
- **Data Transformation:** Applied transformations in Power Query (e.g., column splitting, merging, filtering) to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Model Creation:** Loaded the cleaned dataset into Excel’s data model for efficient processing.
- **Visualization Setup:** Created Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts linked with Slicers and Timelines for dynamic filtering.
- **Dashboard Design:** Combined visuals, KPIs, and interactive filters into a single, user-friendly dashboard layout.
